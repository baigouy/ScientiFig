It is just a small GUI that can plot graphs via a Rsession driving the R software (R is the software creating the graph, I am just driving R). The main function of FiguR is, in my eyes, to generate a .figur file that can be opened with ScientiFig and be dynamically plotted/replotted at the right size without losing font and line width settings, ... If you know the R language you can also use your own R/ggplot2 scripts with it (there are a few restrictions though). To make it clear, I developped this tool very quickly and there are quite some ggplot2 functionalities that are missing. There are several other and probably better GUIs for R that are far more complete than (for example have a look at Deducer, http://www.deducer.org/pmwiki/index.php?n=Main.DeducerManual?from=Main.HomePage), but on the other hand our small tool strongly simplifies graph integration in scientific figures and therefore can be of interest for people. If you use FiguR just to create simple graphs for a publication and are limited for space then you should rather acknowledge R, Rsession, Rserve and ggplot2 than my tool (click on Help>Citations to get a full list of citations).
